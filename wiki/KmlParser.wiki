[http://code.google.com/apis/kml/ KML] is a pretty large markup language and much of it does not apply to Visualize History.  So the vishis site will parse KML files, but will ignore things irrelevant to its display of history.

This page will get more concrete once I find some good examples of how people use KML and I implement those

For now, I will just write reminders of things that come up along the way.
 * Placemark.address => Event.location?
 * Placemark.!TimePrimitive and not just .!TimeSpan
